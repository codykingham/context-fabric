# MCP Tutorials

Learn to use Context-Fabric's MCP server with AI assistants like Claude.

## Learning Path

These tutorials assume you have the MCP server running and connected to Claude Desktop (or another MCP client). See [Server Setup](/docs/mcp/guides/server-setup) if you haven't configured that yet.

### 1. Corpus Discovery

Start here. Learn the exploration workflow that helps you (and the AI) understand what's in a corpus before querying it.

[Corpus Discovery →](/docs/mcp/tutorials/corpus-discovery)

### 2. Building Queries

Master the search template syntax. This tutorial covers feature constraints, structural patterns, and relation operators.

[Building Queries →](/docs/mcp/tutorials/building-queries)

### 3. Analyzing Results

Learn to work with search results effectively—different return types, pagination, and statistical analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Context-Fabric MCP server installed (`pip install context-fabric[mcp]`)
- MCP server configured with at least one corpus
- Claude Desktop or another MCP client connected

## What You'll Learn

By the end of these tutorials, you'll be able to:

- Explore an unfamiliar corpus systematically
- Write search queries for complex linguistic patterns
- Use different return types for different analytical needs
- Page through large result sets efficiently
- Analyze feature distributions across search results

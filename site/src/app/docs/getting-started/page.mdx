# Getting Started

Context-Fabric is a graph-based corpus engine for annotated text. It handles the kind of linguistic data that makes traditional databases weep: standoff annotation, overlapping hierarchies, millions of interconnected nodes. Built on the proven [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric) data model, it uses memory-mapped storage for production deployments where performance actually matters.

## Installation

Install the core library:

```bash
pip install context-fabric
```

For AI agent integration via the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
pip install context-fabric[mcp]
```

<Callout type="info" title="Python Version">
Context-Fabric requires Python 3.10 or later.
</Callout>

## What You Get

The core library provides:

- **Fast Loading** — Memory-mapped arrays mean instant corpus loads after initial compilation. No deserialization overhead.
- **Graph Navigation** — Traverse containment hierarchies, walk nodes in canonical order, locate slots within structures.
- **Pattern Search** — Query structural patterns across the entire corpus. Find all verses containing a specific verb form, or all clauses with a particular syntactic structure.
- **Feature Access** — Linguistic annotations (part of speech, morphology, syntactic roles) available as node and edge features.

The MCP server extends this to AI workflows:

- **Agent-Friendly API** — Ten tools designed for iterative, token-efficient exploration.
- **Corpus Discovery** — Let Claude or GPT-4 explore what features and node types exist before querying.
- **Structured Results** — Search returns references, not raw data dumps.

## A Quick Taste

Here's what working with Context-Fabric looks like:

```python
import cfabric

# Download a corpus (BHSA - the Hebrew Bible)
path = cfabric.download('bhsa')

# Load it
CF = cfabric.Fabric(locations=path)
api = CF.loadAll()

# Find all words with lexeme "MLK" (king)
results = api.S.search('''
  word lex=MLK
''')

# How many?
print(f"Found {len(list(results))} occurrences")
```

That's the entire Hebrew Bible—426,555 words, each one tagged with morphology, syntax, and discourse features by scholars who probably needed a vacation afterward. Context-Fabric queries all of it in milliseconds.

# Core Library Tutorials

These tutorials teach you to use Context-Fabric's Python API directly. If you're writing scripts, building applications, or need programmatic control over corpus analysis, start here.

## Learning Path

### 1. Loading Corpora

Set up your environment and load your first corpus. Understand the `Fabric` class, `loadAll()`, and the API object.

[Start with Loading Corpora](/docs/core/tutorials/loading-corpora)

### 2. Corpus Discovery

Every corpus has different features. Learn to explore what's available before diving into analysis. The `describe` module provides introspection functions for any corpus.

### 3. Feature Access

Learn to query node and edge features. The `F` and `E` APIs are your primary tools for accessing linguistic annotations.

### 4. Navigation

Move through the corpus structure. The `L` API handles containment relationships; the `T` API retrieves text; the `N` API manages node ordering.

### 5. Search Patterns

Write search templates to find linguistic patterns. The `S.search()` method uses the same template syntax as the MCP server.

### 6. Working with BHSA

A deep dive into the Hebrew Bible corpus. Practical examples of the APIs applied to real linguistic questions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Context-Fabric installed: `pip install context-fabric`
- A corpus to work with (see [Available Corpora](/docs/corpora))

## Text-Fabric Compatibility

If you have existing Text-Fabric code, it works with Context-Fabric. The only change is the import:

```python
# Text-Fabric
from tf.fabric import Fabric

# Context-Fabric (just change the import)
from cfabric import Fabric
```

The `F`, `L`, `T`, `S`, `E`, and `N` APIs are identical.
